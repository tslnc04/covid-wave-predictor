                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>
                    An AI has been trained on the hundreds of thousands of
                    county-level data points available from the
                    <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data"
                        >New York Times</a
                    >
                    to recognize when a wave of COVID is about to hit. The
                    percentages represent the probability of an imminent COVID
                    wave. For this purpose, a COVID wave is when the 7-day
                    moving average of daily new cases is 5% higher after 14
                    days. That means if the moving average of cases is 5% higher
                    two weeks from now then today would be classified as having
                    an imminent COVID wave.

                <p>
                    Lookup uses the FIPS code for each county, which is
                    different from the more common ZIP codes used by the postal
                    service, so search by the county and state name.
